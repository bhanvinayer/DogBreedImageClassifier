Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: yes, all the three model architectures classfied Dog_01 as the same breed- golden retriever.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: yes both images Dog_01 and Dog_02 were classified as the same breed of dog by all the three models.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: yes the non-dog images were correctly classified.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All the three model architectures gave the same result with same accuracy however what distinguised them from eachother are their timings. AlexNet having the lowest time followed by ResNet followed by vgg. Thus, Alexnet worked the fastest for the images i uploaded. 
However, from the research VGG is the biggest network out of three and therefore at the time of training it might have fit the distribution when exposed to a very large dataset as compared to Alexnet having the lowest time.
